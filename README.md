# Personal Portfolio Website â€“ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is my personal portfolio website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way for people to connect with me professionally. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and simple portfolio to represent my work and personality.
